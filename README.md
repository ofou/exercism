Here are my [exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/ofou) solutions! I'm using this amazing platform in order to tidy up my coding skills and getting closer to the community. I love using this tool to improve my skills because it makes great use of the command line, plus it give you great community feedback if you use the mentor mode, it even include great tests for your code. It's taking me long hours so far but I'm eager to finish the full list of problems. I'm tracking my coding time using [rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/rp/ofou/). If you have any comments or suggestions about my code, questions on how to start coding on exercism, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ofou/exercism/issues/new), I'll very happy to help you out, or reciving any kind of feedback from the community!

I'm also using [`leetcode`](https://github.com/ofou/leetcode), [`codesignal`](https://github.com/ofou/codesignal) and [`freeCodeCamp`](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ofou), all great ways to improve your skills further.
